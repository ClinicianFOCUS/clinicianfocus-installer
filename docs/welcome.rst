Welcome to the FreeScribe Project
=================================

Welcome to the FreeScribe project! This project aims to provide an intelligent medical scribe application that assists healthcare professionals by transcribing conversations and generating medical notes.

Installer Intro
---------------

This installer aims to help you install the **ClinicianFOCUS Toolbox Installer** step by step. This is a remote server for the FreeScribe project. This runs 2 docker containers for the Whisper Server and Large Language Model. The use case is for a office to run these on a powerful Nvidia GPU enabled server and have less powerful systems run the client and connect remotely. This allows less powerful systems to run FreeScribe with out any hardware requirements.
